    "Token-based similarity measures compare two strings by first dividing them into a set of tokens\n",
    "using a tokenization function, which we denote as tokenize(Â·). Intuitively, tokens correspond to\n",
    "substrings of the original string. As a simple example, assume the tokenization function splits a\n",
    "string into tokens based on whitespace characters.Then, the string Sean Connery results in the set\n",
    "of tokens *{Sean,Connery}*. As we will show throughout our discussion, the main advantage of\n",
    "token-based similarity measures is that the similarity is less sensitive to word swaps compared to\n",
    "similarity measures that consider a string as a whole (notably edit-based measures). That is, the\n",
    "comparison of *Sean Connery* and *Connery Sean* will yield a maximum similarity score because both\n",
    "strings contain the exact same tokens. On the other hand, typographical errors within tokens are\n",

    "\n",
    "The Jaccard coefficient is a similarity measure that, in its most general form, compares two sets P\n",
    "and Q with the following formula:\n",
    "$$Jaccard(P,Q) = \\frac{|P \\cap Q|}{|P \\cup Q|}$$\n",
    "Essentially,the Jaccard coefficient measures the fraction of the data that is shared between P\n",
    "and Q, compared to all data available in the union of these two sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An advantage of the Jaccard coefficient is that it is not sensitive to word swaps. Indeed, the\n",
    "score of two names *John Smith* and *Smith John* would correspond to the score of exactly equal strings because the Jaccard coefficient considers only whether a token exists in a string, not at which position."
